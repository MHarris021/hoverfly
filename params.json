{"name":"Hoverfly","tagline":"an open source transparent service virtualization tool","body":"# Hoverfly: dependencies without the sting\r\n\r\nHoverfly is an experiment in lightweight, open source [service virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_virtualization). Using Hoverfly, you can virtualize your application dependencies to create a self-contained development/test environment.\r\n\r\nHoverfly is a proxy written in Go. It can capture HTTP(s) traffic between an application under test and external services, and then replace the external services. Another powerful feature - middleware modules, where users can introduce their own custom logic. Middleware modules can be written in any language. Hoverfly uses Redis for persistence.\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n[SpectoLabs](https://www.specto.io/)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nApache License version 2.0 [See LICENSE for details](https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/blob/master/LICENSE).\r\n\r\n(c) [SpectoLabs](https://specto.io) 2015.","google":"UA-66641732-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
